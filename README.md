# Animal-Life
This is my final year project which resulted in a 72% overall grade. The  purpose of reducing the population of stray animals and improve the matter of animal welfare.

Key Features:
- Stray animal reporting system: Mobile users can upload relevent information in regards to strayed animals. Admins will then be notified on a web portal enabling them to contact relevant rescue teams.
- Pet adoption system: Adverts are uploaded by authorised users through a web portal allowing sheltered animals to be put into a new loving home, ultimately reducing shelter capacity.
- Educational feature: Enabling proffesionals a space to share their positive thoughts such as "new owner guides" and more.

All is connected to a firebase database!
